## Unofficial Razer GRUB Theme
This is a Grand Unified Bootloader Theme (the screen that appears when the computer is booting) for Linux. I use it with Ubuntu 17.10 and Windows 8.1.

For more background and information on how I got my Razer Blade 14" (2015 Model) to dual boot Linux Ubuntu alongside Windows and customization process you can read my articles:
